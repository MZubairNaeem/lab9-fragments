    <string name="cry_for_a_shadow">Cry for a Shadow is an instrumental rock piece recorded by the Beatles on 22 June 1961. They recorded the song at Friedrich-Ebert-Halle, Hamburg-Harburg, Germany while they were performing as Tony Sheridans backup band for a few tracks, under the moniker the Beat Brothers. It was written by George Harrison with John Lennon, as a parody of the Shadows style. (The Shadows, who backed Cliff Richard, were the biggest British instrumental rock and roll group at the time of the recording.) It imitates the lead guitar with typical Hank Marvin licks, the melodic bass fills, and even has an imitation during the second middle eight of the famous Jet Harris yell. It is the only Beatles track to be credited to Lennon and Harrison alone.It was intended to be released as the B-side of Why, another Sheridan song with the Beatles, but the record company chose to release another song instead. In early 1964, as the Beatles were gaining popularity, the record company Polydor decided to release it, with Why changed to the b-side. According to Bill Harry, editor of the Mersey Beat newspaper, Cry for a Shadows original title was "Beatle Bop".
        It was also released in 1995 as part of the Anthology 1 compilation.
        San Francisco new wave group Translator released a cover version of this song as a B-side in 1983. It is included in the cover version record B-Sides the Beatles by rock band the Smithereens.</string>
